# learning-git

Let's start with a file and see if we can make changes to the file and put them in master.

You should:

- `git branch` to create a new branch where you'll make changes.
- Change this file.
- `git add` to add the changes as candidates for a commit
- `git commit -m "something here` to make the commit
- `git push` to push the branch
- Make a pull request
